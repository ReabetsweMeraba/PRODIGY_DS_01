# Bar Chart Visualization of Country vs Value

## Objective
This script aims to create a bar chart to visualize the relationship between different countries and their corresponding values.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Categories**: A list of country names.
- **Values**: A list of values associated with each country.

The values are initially provided as strings with commas (representing large numbers), which are then converted into numeric values for proper plotting.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Preparation**: The values are cleaned by removing commas and converting the data to float types.
2. **Plotting**: A bar chart is generated using `matplotlib` with the first 30 countries and their values plotted on the x and y axes, respectively.
3. **Labeling**: 
   - X-axis represents country names.
   - Y-axis represents the corresponding values.
   - The chart includes labels for both axes and a title.
